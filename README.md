# Functional Recursive Portals in Unity (URP)

A recursive, physically-accurate portal system for Unity's Universal Render Pipeline.

![Portals Banner](banner.jpg)

## Overview

This repository features a complete portal system which renders portal surfaces recursively (i.e. renders portals through portals), allows players to shoot new portals (and corrects the positions to avoid overhangs and wall intersections), and seamlessly lets objects warp through the portals (with temporary clones making sure the objects look correct travelling through the portals). The original series of tutorials for the built-in pipeline can be found [here](https://danielilett.com/2019-12-01-tut4-intro-portals/).

## Software

## Authors

This project and the corresponding tutorial was created by Daniel Ilett.

This project was publically released on February 8th 2021.
